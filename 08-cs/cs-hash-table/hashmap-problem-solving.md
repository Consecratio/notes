# Problem Solving with Hash Tables

With only a few exceptions of very low-level programming languages, we can use built in hash tables for efficient problem solving. 

Due to their quick insertion and search, some problems which would take ages using nesting loops and arrays, such as the famous [two sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/), can be solve with minimal computational power using a hash.

In Javascript, good ol' objects are hash tables, and in Python dictionaries are hash tables. We are of course familiar with using these data structures as containers for related data that needs to be grouped, but using them for problem solving means thinking about utilizing them in a different way.

## Using Hash Tables 

Consider the following problem from [Leet code](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/):
